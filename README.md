# cesium-server
Local aircraft testing on GeoFS  
----
This allows you to run a server for GeoFS from your local aircraft files.

Before running this, you'll need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

After doing that, open a terminal/command prompt in this directory:

 - `npm install`
 - `npm run geofs`

You should now have a working aircraft server for GeoFS!
Create as many folders as you like in `testing/` and put aircraft files in those folders
